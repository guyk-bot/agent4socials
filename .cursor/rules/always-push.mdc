# Git: Commit and push after changes

After making any code or config changes in this project:

1. **Stage** all changes: `git add -A`
2. **Commit** with a clear message describing what changed: `git commit -m "Brief description"`
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push origin main` (or the current branch)

Do this in the same turn as the edits, unless the user explicitly asks not to push. Use `git_write` and `network` permissions when running git commands.
